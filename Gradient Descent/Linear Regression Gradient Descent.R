# Linear Regression - Gradient Descent

# Andrew Ng's Machine Learning class

# Let's start off, by generating some bogus data with known characteristics. 
# Let's make y just a noisy version of x. 
# Let's also add 3 to give the intercept term something to do.


# generate random data in which y is a noisy function of x

x <- runif(1000, -5, 5)
y <- x + rnorm(1000) + 3

# fit a linear model
res <- lm( y ~ x )
print(res)

# Fitting a linear model, we should get a slope of 1 and an intercept of 3. 
# Sure enough, we get pretty close. Let's plot it and see how it looks.

# plot the data and the model

plot(x,y, col=rgb(0.2,0.4,0.6,0.4), main='Linear regression')
abline(res, col='blue')

# As a learning exercise, we'll do the same thing using gradient descent. As discussed previously, 
# the main idea is to take the partial derivative of the cost function with 
# respect to theta. That gradient, multiplied by a learning rate, becomes the update rule for 
# the estimated values of the parameters. Iterate and things should converge nicely.

# squared error cost function
cost <- function(X, y, theta) {
  sum( (X %*% theta - y)^2 ) / (2*length(y))
}

# learning rate and iteration limit
alpha <- 0.01
num_iters <- 1000

# keep history
cost_history <- double(num_iters)
theta_history <- list(num_iters)

# initialize coefficients
theta <- matrix(c(0,0), nrow=2)

# add a column of 1's for the intercept coefficient
X <- cbind(1, matrix(x))

# gradient descent
for (i in 1:num_iters) {
  error <- (X %*% theta - y)
  delta <- t(X) %*% error / length(y)
  theta <- theta - alpha * delta
  cost_history[i] <- cost(X, y, theta)
  theta_history[[i]] <- theta
}

print(theta)

# As expected, theta winds up with the same values as lm returned. 
# Let's do some more plotting:
  
# plot data and converging fit
  plot(x,y, col=rgb(0.2,0.4,0.6,0.4), main='Linear regression by gradient descent')
for (i in c(1,3,6,10,14,seq(20,num_iters,by=10))) {
  abline(coef=theta_history[[i]], col=rgb(0.8,0,0,0.3))
}
abline(coef=theta, col='blue')


# Taking a look at how quickly the cost decreases, I might have done with fewer iterations.
